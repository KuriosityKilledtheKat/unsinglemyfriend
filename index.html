    <h2>what even is this??</h2>
    <p><em>unsingle my friend</em> is a collective hosting a matchmaking experiment where you, the friend of someone who is single, send your beloved-but-hopelessly-single friend into the dating wild.
    we turn them into a trading card, you bring that card to a chaotic IRL meetup, and then you trade cards with other friends of singles.
    It‚Äôll be like a Chinese marriage market... if the aunties were all in their 30s, drinking natural wine, and emotionally invested in your dating life.</p>

    <h2>faq</h2>
    <h3>is this an ad for a dumb dating app</h3>
    <p>no i dont like dating apps and also</p>

    <h3>why are you doing this</h3>
    <p>Two reasons:<br>
i have some single friends i think should be not single. While i‚Äôm more than happy to manage their dating apps, i am bored of running my friends‚Äô dating apps and figure this would be a better, more scalable way.<br>
because i desire more chaos in my life and i want to do something lighthearted and silly to distract from the war in iraq, the genocide in palestine/DRC, and the rest of the world being on fire</p>

    <h3>can I submit more than one friend?</h3>
    <p>yeah. but you should know them well enough to vouch for them.</p>

    <h3>do i/The Single have to be in SF?</h3>
    <p>i mean you have to show up to an event in SF.</p>

    <h3>does my friend need to approve this?</h3>
    <p>yeah. we‚Äôre not here to violate hipaa. enthusiastic consent only. and only friends you can personally endorse.</p>

    <h3>will they see the card before the event?</h3>
    <p>no. we will</p>
